        I am currently double majoring in Media Arts and Japanese and I am also in the Davidson Honors College, and though I am a senior, I will not be graduating until the Fall of 2023 as I have two more classes that I have to take that I was unable to take this semester. While my goal in the Media Arts degree is to be well rounded, I most enjoy the story creation classes, with screenwriting having been my favorite to take. I am undecided if I wish to pursue this full time, as I recognize it is a competitive field and difficult to make it in, but I hope to use this semseter to talk to various professors and other experts to help me decide what the best course of action is. I may lean more into my Japanese degree and pursue a job in Japan, as when I did my study abroad there, I really enjoyed living there and believe that I could live there in a long term capacity.

        Upbringing
      </h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in a military family, with my father having served in the Army for 21 years. I was born in Gelnhausen, Germany while he served there, along with my younger sister who was born a year and half later, but we moved back to the States shortly after. We then lived in Kentucky and then Kansas, though I barely remember either. Most of my childhood memories come from living in Sanford, North Carolina, which we lived in for 5 years. Then we moved to Savannah, Georgia for 2 and a half years before we had the opportunity to move to Europe when my father was offered a job with NATO. So, my family had the chance to live in Rome, Italy for 6 months and Bydgoszcz, Poland for 2 years. After this, my father retired and we moved to Helena, Montana where I finished out high school there. This experience has greatly shaped much of my world view, and I am greatly appreciative of the fact that I have been able to experience so much of the world growing up and can consider myself much more culturally expereince than many of my peers, though I do not claim to know everything or be superior in any regard.
