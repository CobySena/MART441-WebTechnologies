One of the most difficult aspects of this assignment was coming up with the story itself. I didn't want to make something too complicated or convoluted, but I ended up writing a lot more than I had originally intend. Though I am pretty happy with the result. In terms of working with JavaScript, I had a decent enough time working with it, though I did have to take some time to make sure I understood the proper sequence of events a few times.
