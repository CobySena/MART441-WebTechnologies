        Your head feels foggy as you open your eyes. You find yourself on an unfamiliar road in a forested woods you have never seen before. There is a trail that stretches out before you, with a fork in the road ahead of you. Suddenly, a hooded figure appears at the fork, seemingly out of thin air. All that is visible of the face is the mouth. In a voice that is hard to place both the figure's age and gender, it speaks, 'Before you lies a choice. The Left. The Right. What lies down the path you choose?' It lifts its arms to gesture to both paths. Which will you take?
