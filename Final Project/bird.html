        The western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) was designated the official state bird of Montana in 1931. A familiar songbird of open country in the western two-thirds of North America - the western meadowlark was chosen overwhelmingly by Montana's school children to represent the state (Wyoming, North Dakota, Oregon, and Kansas also adopted the western meadowlark as their state bird).

        According to Montana Office of Tourism, Meriwether Lewis (of the Lewis and Clark Expedition) not only "discovered" the bitterroot (Montana's state flower), but was also the first to record a description of the bird that was to become a state symbol of Montana; "Under the date of June 22, 1805, Lewis noted in his journal the appearance of a lark with a yellow breast and black spot on the throat. It resembled in size, action, and color the eastern lark with which he was more familiar, but the song was richer and more varied."
